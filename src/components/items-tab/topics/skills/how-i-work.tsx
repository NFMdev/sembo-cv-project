            <h3>How I Work</h3>
            <p>
                Over the last four years in the IT sector, I've had the opportunity to grow from a junior developer to a team lead.
                My journey started in a fully on-site environment where I developed solutions independently, while closely following
                guidance from my seniors. Daily stand-ups and tools like Trello helped me build structure, responsibility, and clarity
                in how I approached my work.

            <p>
                In my current hybrid role, I lead a team while staying deeply involved in both technical decisions and project coordination.
                I work closely with a Product Manager to plan sprints, distribute workloads, and ensure smooth deployments. We rely on Microsoft Teams for daily syncs and Jira for task management.
                I also engage directly with clients to define needs, validate progress, and align on delivery goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                My approach to work is collaborative and structured, with a strong focus on communication, ownership, and continuous improvement.
                Whether working remotely or in the office, I value building trust within the team, staying adaptable, and delivering thoughtful, high-quality solutions.
